# I did it!

if you are reading this then that means I have successfully added 2 branches to this repo from WSL terminal. 

## Branches:
### changingTextColor
### master

If you are reading this then I can successfully make a readme file even though I do not know the proper formatting... yet...

Thank you, goodbye... for now...

ps I am now going to attempt to pull this readme file through my terminal.

### edit
I have pulled this file but I found a couple mistakes:
  - I initially made this file in the changingTextColor branch on Github.
  - I pulled this branch to my master branch in my terminal... whoops

## Remember:
  - Be in the correct branch on Github
  - Be in the correct branch in terminal
