If you are reading this then you have found the master but I initially made the changingTextColor branch my default. I wasn't sure if I was going to push the master branch but hey, I guess I did. The more practice the better.
The changingTextColor branch has a better readme... sorry

## update:

don't know what I am doing.
I cannot figure out how to push and pull only from a specific branch in Github, if that is even a thing...
